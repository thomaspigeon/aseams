# ASEAMS Package

**ASEAMS** is a Python toolkit implementing **Adaptive Multilevel Splitting (AMS)** techniques for molecular dynamics simulations, including:
- Collective variables (`cvs`)
- Initial condition samplers (`inicondsamplers`)
- AMS routine (`ams`)
- Langevin integrators (`utils`)

It is designed to work seamlessly with the [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) molecular simulation framework.
